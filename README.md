# Scania-Trucks-APS-Failure-Prediction
Machine Learning for Mechanical Engineers: A skill often overlooked or thought to be strictly “for the other engineers”. Mechanical engineers are to see a huge increase in the demand for programming and the understanding of new cost-reduction techniques through machine learning.

# The Background and Problem Statement

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets’ positive class consists of component failures 
for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS. The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.
